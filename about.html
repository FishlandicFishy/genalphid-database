<h1>About</h1>
<p>Genalphid is a term I have coined to refer to people within Generation Alpha.</p>
<p>The Genalphid Language is spoken by people within Generation Alpha. Not to be confused with brainrot slang.</p>
<p>It refers to the midpoint of the two extremes of Gen Alpha speech: Pure screaming and Cantonese/Putonghua/English/Any other language. This means that neither screaming nor any other language would be considered the Genalphid Language.</p>
<p>It is previously falsely determined to be a language isolate, but further research shows that it is influenced primarily by Cantonese, English, and Putonghua. Other influences include other dialects of Chinese.</p>
<p>Research on the Genalphid Language is still ongoing. Many of the words, its grammar, and its full phonology are yet to be deciphered.</p>
